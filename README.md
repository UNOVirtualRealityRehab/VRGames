# Description
This application is a collection of games designed to help with the rehabilitation process for people who have suffered a stroke or similar brain injury by creating games that encourage repetitive movements but in an engaging way. This project is an attempt at gamifying the rehabilitation process. There are four proof-of-concept games included. 
1. A game where you pop balloons with darts.
2. A game where you throw paper airplanes.
3. A game where you climb a wall.
4. A game where you stack blocks.

To use this application, the files must be built in the Unity engine and deployed to a virtual reality headset such as the Meta Quest 2.
